# Python-Exercises
These are a set of python exercises

PrimeNumberDeterminer.py takes the inputed number then puts it into loop to check whether it's prime or not. It will then tell you whether it's a prime number or not.

NumberOrganizer.py takes the inputed string of words then makes it into a list to alphabitize. It will then convert it back to a string that will be printed out.
